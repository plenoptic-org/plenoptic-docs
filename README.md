> [!CAUTION]
> This repo should not be edited manually.

Built documentation for the plenoptic package. Note that this repository just
contains the *built* documentation for the package, the source of the
documentation lies [in the main project
repo](https://github.com/plenoptic-org/plenoptic/tree/main/docs). 

We use this repo essentially as a webserver: the html is placed here and then
hosted on github pages, and we treat this repo as "shallow", not tracking the
history. The building and pushing is all handled by Jenkins jobs triggered in
the main repo.
